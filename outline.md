## Introduction

- **Problem Definition:**  
  *What problem are you trying to solve and why?*

  - If implementing an existing paper: describe the paper's objectives and reasons for choosing this paper.
  - If doing something new: detail your motivation and how you arrived at this topic.
  - Clearly state the type of problem (Classification, Regression, Structured prediction, Reinforcement Learning, Unsupervised Learning, etc.).

## Related Work

- **Literature Review:**
  - Briefly summarize (one paragraph) at least one relevant paper/article/blog beyond the paper you are implementing or the novel idea you're researching.

- **References and Implementations:**
  - Include URLs to any public implementations you find relevant.
  - *(Treat this as a "living list" and update it as you find new resources.)*

## Data

- **Dataset Description:**
  - Brief description (if standard dataset like MNIST, briefly mention; otherwise, explain source and collection method).
  - Size of the dataset.
  - Discuss preprocessing requirements (if any).

## Metrics

- **Definition of Success:**
  - Clearly define what constitutes "success."

- **Experiments Planned:**
  - Specify experiments to be conducted.
  - Justify the choice of metrics (accuracy or alternative metrics).
  - For existing paper implementations, mention original metrics and expectations.
  - If novel, explain how performance will be assessed.

- **Goals:**
  - Base, target, and stretch goals.

## Ethics

*(Select and discuss at least two of the following points relevant to your project.)*

- Broader societal issues related to your chosen problem space.
- Suitability of deep learning approach for your problem.
- Dataset collection and labeling concerns, representativeness, and possible biases.
- Major stakeholders and implications of algorithmic errors.
- Methods to quantify or measure error/success and related implications.
- *(Optional)* Any additional ethical issue related to your algorithm.

## Division of Labor

- Brief outline of each group memberâ€™s responsibilities.
